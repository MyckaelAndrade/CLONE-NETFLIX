<h1 align = "center"> Recreating a Netflix interface with Digital Innovation One </h1>
Recreate a Netflix interface using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. In this project you will learn: how to structure a layout, CSS3 techniques with containers and variables, how to position the elements with Flexbox and how to use Jquery plugins.
The images of the films included in this project were taken from the website [The Movie Database - TMDb] (https://www.themoviedb.org/). The carousel created using the jQuery plugin [Owl carousel 2] (https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/), no website contains several carousel examples.
In this project, we made some changes, such as a Netflix logo that no original project does not have. The font used in the original was Arial, I already included a <b> Roboto </b> font from [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
